# WritingPrompts_Data_Analysis
Scraping and analyzing the posts from subreddit r/WritingPrompts

This repo will focus on collecting data from the r/WritingPrompts subreddit on Reddit. Specifically, it will be using the Pushshift API to collect every post in the subreddit's history. After this, the WPPresentNotebook will focus on cleaning the data and analyzing it, looking for trends in the frequency of words. Additionally, some time will be spent attempting to construct a machine learning model to predict the score of a post based upon its title.
